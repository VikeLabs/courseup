CourseUp is a website built to simplify the experience of searching courses and building timetables for the [University of Victoria](https://uvic.ca) (UVic). The website is a TypeScript app which uses React on the front-end and Firebase on the back-end.

## Develop

If you're interested developing this application, follow these steps to get running a local version of the application.

**Note**: These instructions are for developing the frontend (React). If you wish to develop the backend, please refer to the [README](./functions/README.md) located in `functions` directory in this repository.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/courseup.git
   ```
3. Run `npm ci`
   - Tip: Avoid using `npm install` unless you're installing a package.
4. Start the frontend using `npm start`
   - This will start the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) development server.
   - All requests to the backend will be routed to the **staging** environment of CourseUp. This can be overrode using the `proxy` property located within `package.json`.

You will now be able to develop the frontend React application. Any changes made to the code will hot-reload upon save.

Failing to compile on a windows environment?
Run the following commands and then retry step 4:
`git fetch --all`
`git reset --hard`

If you get stuck setting up the development environment, try Google **then** if you're still stuck drop a question in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/VikeLabs/courseup/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Directory Structure

CourseUp uses a defined structure for directories. Make sure you read up on our [frontend directory structure guidelines](https://github.com/VikeLabs/courseup/wiki/Frontend-Directory-Structure) before submitting contributions.

### Chakra UI

CourseUp uses the component library [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as it's main source of components, styling, and formatting. You will notice throughout the codebase there is _no_ use of raw HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<li>`, etc. as Chakra provides us with clean alternatives that help keep the code consistent and the website looking good.

### Fetchers

You will notice there are React hooks like `useGetCourse`. This is provided by [resful-react](https://github.com/contiamo/restful-react/) to interact with our backend RESTful API. Please take a brief read of [resful-react](https://github.com/contiamo/restful-react/) to understand what it provides.

We use the [code generation](https://github.com/contiamo/restful-react/#code-generation-from-openapi--swagger-specs) capabilities to generate React hooks for all the resource routes to our backend. The generated code is located in [here.](./src/shared/fetchers.tsx). **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE** as it is supposed to be generated from the OpenAPI spec.

To regenerate the fetchers, run `npm run fetchers:generate`. This is **only required if the backend controllers change**.

## Contribute

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Make sure you read up on our [contributions guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting contributions.

## Deployment

Hosting is provided by [VikeLabs](https://vikelabs.ca) using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). CourseUp has a **staging** and **production** environment. Changes will be first deployed to staging to be verified before moving onto production.

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework. You can execute tests by running `npm test`.

This will execute tests using Jest files with the extension `*.test*`.

`npx jest --watch` will put Jest into watch mode, which will execute tests as files change.

## UVic Course Scraper

The website uses the npm package [`uvic-course-scraper`](https://github.com/VikeLabs/uvic-course-scraper). The package is a web-scraping tool made with TypeScript that is the main way of extracting data from UVic. It is contributed to and maintained by the original development team of `courseup`.

The motivation of [`uvic-course-scraper`](https://github.com/VikeLabs/uvic-course-scraper) is to abstract away the parsing and scraping required to obtain data. It is not designed to do anything else.

## VikeLabs

This project was developed by students at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca) as part of [VikeLabs](https://vikelabs.ca), which is a student-led software development club.
